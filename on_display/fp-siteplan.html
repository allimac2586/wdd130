      <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
      <p class="p_plan">
        What kind of rare item would you like to own? If you owned it would you
        display it? Would you ever consider displaying it on a site where you
        could share history, notable facts etc and where others could comment
        and discuss the information about your rare item? Imagine if you wanted
        to expand your collection of rare items. This same site will offer
        options to buy, sell or trade items with the ability to browse
        collections by type and keywords. This site will create an amazing
        community with opportunities to share the love of collecting as well as
        an opportunity to expand and progress your collection.

        <p class="column_p">
          While enjoying others displays you can also expand upon your own
          collection by taking note of others' items that are up for purchase
          and/or for trade.

        <p class="column_p">
          On the other side of that same coin (pun intended for you
          numismatists) you can also put items in your own collection up for
          sale or set parameters for a trade. Let your collecting experience
          expand while enjoying others amazing collections.

        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p class="column_p">
          We started this journey with an idea to share our love of collecting
          with others. We wanted to find a way to connect with collectors of all
          types to share our displays and create a like minded community.
        </p>
        <p class="column_p">
          We love sharing our interest with others but more than that we love
          seeing a person's eyes light up in excitement when sharing their
          passion. We hope to see many eyes light up in excitement when sharing
          and growing within our on display community.

      <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Is it free to sign up for the site? Are there premium memberships? How
        do I make an offer on something in someone's display? If someone agrees
        to make a trade how do I ensure that they send the item when I send
        mine? Someone is saying inappropriate things in the comments of my
        display page, how do I report them? Someone agreed to purchase a piece
        from my collection. Their payment isn't going through. What should I do?

      <h3>Logo</h3>
      <p>
        I have an idea for a logo. I know that's not part of our assignment this
        time but just throwing this placeholder in here for now. just need to
        figure out how to draw it up.

      <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        I still haven't decided fully on the color scheme. I'm playing around
        with different colors. I just need to find the right ones on coolors.co.
        That site is super fun. But I'm shooting for some light grays, blues and
        maybe some highlight colors. I've been perusing some sites to get some
        ideas. But I'll list some placeholders for now. The colors are fairly
        similar to my rafting site. Apparently I have certain colors I like.
        I'll need to try to break out of that.

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        Montserrat for the main text. Open Sans for titles. May change those or
        possibly add different ones for different sections. We'll see. I
        probably shouldn't make things too complicated.
